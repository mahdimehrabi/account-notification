### Technical Test Specification

#### Project Overview:
Develop a concise banking application using Golang, emphasizing Golang concurrency, channels, and eventing.
The primary functionality should involve concurrent fund transfers between accounts, and after each transaction,
notify the related accounts. Additionally, implement a mechanism to log these notifications within a file specific to each account.

#### Key Features:

1. Account Management:
   - Implement a basic account structure with an account ID and balance.
   - Support the creation of multiple accounts.

2. Concurrent Fund Transfer:
   - Utilize Goroutines for concurrent fund transfers between accounts.
   - Implement a channel-based mechanism for transaction coordination and communication.

3. Eventing:
   - After each fund transfer, trigger an event to notify the related accounts.
   - Implement a mechanism to capture these notifications for further processing.

4. Notification Logging:
   - Write a log file for each account to capture transaction-related notifications.
   - Append new notifications to the existing log for each account.

5. Concurrency and Safety:
   - Ensure safe concurrent fund transfers without race conditions or conflicts.
   - Demonstrate the use of locks, mutexes, or any appropriate concurrency control mechanism.

6. Database Integration (Optional):
   - Optionally, integrate a simple in-memory database for account storage.
   - Focus on concurrent read and write operations.

7. ReSTful API (Optional):
   - Optionally, design a minimal ReSTful API for initiating fund transfers.
   - Include endpoints for transferring funds between accounts.

8. Automated Tests:
   - Write unit tests to validate the concurrent fund transfer functionality.
   - Ensure that concurrent transactions are processed accurately and safely.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

- Concurrency, Channels, and Eventing:
  - Assess the implementation of concurrent fund transfers, channels, and event triggering.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the eventing mechanism for notifying related accounts.

- Golang Proficiency:
  - Evaluate the code structure, adherence to Golang best practices, and use of language features.

- Notification Logging:
  - Assess the implementation of notification logging within separate files for each account.

- Database Integration (Optional):
  - If implemented, assess the integration with an in-memory database and concurrent data access.

- ReSTful API (Optional):
  - If implemented, assess the design and functionality of the API.

- Automated Testing:
  - Review the coverage and effectiveness of automated tests, especially regarding concurrent scenarios.

#### Submission Guidelines:

1. Repository:
   - Create a GitHub repository for the project.

2. Documentation:
   - Provide clear documentation on how to run the application and execute tests.

3. Readme:
   - Include a well-structured Readme with project overview, setup instructions, and any additional notes.

4. Submission Deadline:
   - Specify the deadline for submitting the test.
